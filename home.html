                <td>
                    Cloud migration significantly reduces expenses for your business. With a pay-as-you-go model, you 
                    only pay for the resources you use, eliminating the need for costly proprietary servers. This cost-efficient 
                    approach ensures that as your business operates, you continue to save money compared to traditional data centers.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Initial setup and migration costs can be high, and long-term expenses may vary based on usage.
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Backup</strong></td>
                <td>
                    Cloud providers offer robust backup and recovery solutions with just a single click. These capabilities 
                    ensure that your critical data is secure, easily recoverable, and protected from unforeseen disruptions, 
                    providing peace of mind and uninterrupted operations.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Dependency on the cloud provider's reliability and potential issues with service outages.

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Scalability</strong></td>
                <td>
                    As your business grows, cloud resources grow with you. The cloud offers virtually unlimited scalability, 
                    enabling you to adjust capacity to meet your needs in real-time. Whether scaling up during peak demand or 
                    scaling down during slower periods, the cloud ensures you never overpay for unused capacity.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Unpredictable costs due to sudden scaling needs during high traffic periods.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Simplified Management</strong></td>
                <td>
                    Managing your infrastructure has never been easier. With central management tools, organizations can monitor 
                    and control their data center and cloud resources from a single, unified screen. This streamlined approach 
                    reduces complexity and improves efficiency in day-to-day operations.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Requires training for IT staff to adapt to new management tools and processes.
                </td>
