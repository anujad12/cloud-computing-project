    <h4 style="text-align: center;"> History of Cloud Computing</h4>
    <p>Cloud computing is the “on-demand access of computing resources… over the internet with pay-per-use pricing” 
    (Susnjara, 2024). It allows companies to offload the high costs associated with maintaining mainframe computers.
     Since cloud services operate on a pay-per-use model, transitioning to the cloud often proves to be a more 
     cost-effective solution.</p>

     <p>Beyond cost savings, cloud computing offers unlimited scalability, enabling companies to seamlessly scale their
      capacity up or down based on website traffic and business needs.</p>


    <p>The concept of global networking was first introduced by J.C.R. Licklider through a series of 
    groundbreaking memos. However, cloud computing as we know it today gained significant traction in 
    2002 with the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which pioneered the commercialization of cloud technology.</p>

    <p> Since then, the use of cloud computing by businesses has increased exponentially. According to Gartner, <q>...forecasts 
        spending on cloud security to grow 24% in 2024, making it the highest growth of all segments in the global security and risk 
        management market. This increased investment is necessary as the continued shift to cloud unlocks new and more attack 
        opportunities. 
        In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2027, more than 70% of enterprises will use industry cloud platforms to accelerate their 
        business initiatives, up from less than 15% in 2023. With this increased use of cloud, organizations must invest more in 
        technology to protect their data, applications, and infrastructure services.</q> </p>
